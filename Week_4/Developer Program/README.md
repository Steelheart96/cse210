Jumper is a python project made by Eric Woll.

This project is hangman reskinned. The man is hanging from a parachute instead of a noose. You goal is to guess the word that is randomly chosen from the "words.txt" file. The parachute starts to dissapear if you guess a character that is not part of the word. If you guess the word, the man reaches the ground safely. If you fail to guess the word before the parachute dissapears, the man falls.

"textfile.py" was used to remove words from the "words.txt" file that were less than 4 characters long.
